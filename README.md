# My C++ Projects

  ## Minecraft Crafting Table
Currently working on imitating the Crafting System from Minecraft in a primitive manner, made with C++14. An online editor was used for this, otherwise I would have liked to split different parts into files. (Defines, Classes, etc.)

# Python Version
  ## MC CTable in Python
Also making a .py version to test some things in-between languages!
